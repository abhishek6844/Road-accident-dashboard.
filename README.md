## 💡 Methodology:

### 1. Data Loading

**Tool Used:** Microsoft Excel

* Imported **3.6+ lakh rows** of accident data.
* Ensured all data types and headers were properly formatted.
* Retained a raw backup for reference.

**Outcome:** Solid foundation for reliable analysis.

### 2. Data Cleaning

**Process:**

* Replaced incorrect labels (e.g., "Fetal" → **"Fatal"**).
* Removed or corrected blank and invalid entries.
* Used functions like `TEXT()`, `ISBLANK()`, and `IF()`.

**Outcome:** Clean, analysis-ready dataset.

---

### 3. Data Transformation

**Tool Used:** Excel formulas & Calculated Items

* Extracted **Month and Year** from accident date.
* Grouped vehicle types using **Calculated Items** in Pivot Table.

  * e.g., **Cars = Car + Taxi / Private Hire Car**
* Created additional KPIs using formulas.

**Outcome:** Structured, meaningful data categories.
