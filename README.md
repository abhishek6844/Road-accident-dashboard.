Road Accident Analysis Dashboard (Excel)

Applying Road Safety and Casualty Insights through Excel Dashboards: A Case Study on UK Accident Data.

This project is a testament to the power of Excel in transforming raw datasets into meaningful and actionable visual insights that support decision-making in traffic safety and infrastructure planning.

📅 Project Duration:

7 Days

📊 Project Description:

The project focuses on analyzing large-scale road accident data to uncover patterns in severity, vehicle involvement, time trends, and environmental conditions. Using Excel's capabilities, the dashboard brings clarity to accident trends and helps in understanding areas for public safety improvements.

💡 Methodology:

1. Data Loading

Tool Used: Microsoft Excel

Imported 3.6+ lakh rows of accident data.

Ensured all data types and headers were properly formatted.

Retained a raw backup for reference.

Outcome: Solid foundation for reliable analysis.

2. Data Cleaning

Process:

Replaced incorrect labels (e.g., "Fetal" → "Fatal").

Removed or corrected blank and invalid entries.

Used functions like TEXT(), ISBLANK(), and IF().

Outcome: Clean, analysis-ready dataset.

3. Data Transformation

Tool Used: Excel formulas & Calculated Items

Extracted Month and Year from accident date.

Grouped vehicle types using Calculated Items in Pivot Table.

e.g., Cars = Car + Taxi / Private Hire Car

Created additional KPIs using formulas.

Outcome: Structured, meaningful data categories.

4. KPI Definition

Focus Areas:

Fatal, Serious, and Slight Casualty %

Casualties by Vehicle Type (Car, Van, Bus, Bike, Others)

Urban vs Rural Split

Casualties by Road Type, Surface, Light Conditions

Monthly Casualty Trend (2021 vs 2022)

Outcome: Clear and targeted performance indicators.

5. Data Visualization & Dashboard Design

Tools Used: Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Slicers, Icons)

Donut Charts for severity breakdown

Line Chart for Monthly Trends

Tree Map for Road Surface Conditions

Bar Charts for Road Type

Slicers for interactivity

Design Approach:

Custom dark theme (#222B35 background)

Consistent formatting, icons, and layout

User-focused visuals with filter panel

Outcome: Interactive, user-friendly dashboard
